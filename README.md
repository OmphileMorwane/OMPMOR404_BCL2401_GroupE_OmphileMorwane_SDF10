Part 1: Key Terms and Concepts

__My Terms__


__Term/Concept 1__: __Interface__  

__Definition__: An interface is like a set of rules that different parts of a computer program follow when they need to work together. It tells them what kind of information they can share and how to do it, making sure everything runs smoothly even if they're built differently.

__My Understanding__ : 4 

__Example/Application__: A user of the Airbnb app, interacts with the app`s user interface to search for and book accommodations. Behind the scenes, the app communicates with Airbnb's servers, which handle the processing of the search queries and bookings, providing user with a seamless experience for finding and booking accommodations for the trip.

__Term/Concept 2__: __Client-Server Mode__

__Definition__: Client-server mode is a way for devices or programs (clients) to interact with central computers or programs (servers) over a network. The client sends requests for services or resources to the server, and the server responds by providing the requested services or resources. It's like a conversation where the client asks for something, and the server delivers it.

__Example/Application__:  A customer and a waiter interacting in a restaurant. A customer will order food from the waiter and the waiter will deliver. If there is a problem with the food, the customer will ask the waiter for help and the waiter will deliver.

__Term/Concept 3__: __Command-Line API Interaction__

__Definition__: This refers to using the command-line interface to interact with an API. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and menus, you use text-based commands to communicate with the API and perform tasks like retrieving data, sending requests, or executing operations.

__My Understanding__: 5  

__Example/Application__: When you initialize a Git repository, you use the git init command to initialize a new Git repository for your project. This command sets up the necessary Git files and folders in your project directory to start tracking changes, then you use the git add command to add files or changes to the staging area. For example, git add . would add all the files in the current directory to the staging area.
You use the git commit command to commit the changes in the staging area to the repository. For example, git commit -m "Initial commit" would commit the changes with a message describing the changes.
You use the git log command to view the commit history of the repository. This command shows you a list of commits, including the commit message, author, date, and commit hash. These are the examples of command-line API interaction.


__Term/Concept 4__: __REST (Representational State Transfer)__

__Definition__: REST is a way of accessing and interacting with resources on the web (like webpages, data, or services) using standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It emphasizes a stateless client-server architecture, meaning that each request from the client contains all the information needed to understand and process the request, and no client context is stored on the server between requests. This makes REST APIs easy to understand, scalable, and suitable for use on the web.  

__My Understanding__: 4  

__Example/Application__: Using a mobile app to browse and order food from a restaurant. You open the app and browse through the menu to see what dishes are available. When you view the menu, your device sends a GET request to the restaurant's server, asking for the list of available dishes. The server responds with the menu items, and your app displays them on your screen. You decide to order a pizza and cool drink, so you select them from the menu and add them to the cart. When you do this, the device sends a POST request to the server, indicating that you want to add the pizza and a cool drink to your order. The server receives this request, updates your order in its database, and sends back a confirmation message. Later, you realize you want to add extra toppinngs to the pizza. You go back to your cart and update the toppings. When you do this, your device sends a PUT request to the server, indicating that you want to change the toppings of your pizza. The server updates your order accordingly and sends back a confirmation message. Finally, you decide you no longer want the cool drink you added earlier. You remove it from your cart, and your device sends a DELETE request to the server, indicating that you want to remove the cool drink from your order. The server removes the cool drink from your order in its database and sends back a confirmation message.

__Term/Concept 5__: __Remote (Web) APIs__

__Definition__: A remote web API is a set of rules and protocols that allow your software (like an app or website) to communicate with and access services or resources that are located on a server over the internet. It's like a way for your software to ask for information or perform actions on a distant server without needing to know all the technical details of how that server works internally. Instead, you just send requests to the API, and it handles the communication and processing on the server side, sending back the results for your software to use.


__My Understanding__: 5 

__Example/Application__: Using Instagram as an example, it uses a remote web API behind the scenes to interact with its servers and fetch data for your feed. When you open the Instagram app on your phone to browse through posts and photos, the Instagram app sends requests to a remote web API owned by Instagram. These requests ask for things like the latest posts from people you follow or suggestions for new accounts to follow. The Instagram API receives the request from the app and knows how to handle it. It communicates with Instagram's servers, retrieving the requested data such as posts, photos, comments, and user profiles. Once the Instagram API has the data from the servers, it sends a response back to the Instagram app. This response contains the requested information, like the latest posts from your friends or recommended accounts to follow. Finally, the Instagram app receives the response from the API and displays the content on your phone screen. You can see the latest posts from people you follow, explore new content, like and comment on posts, and interact with other users.
